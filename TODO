Pi Camera:
* Some kind of external output, or tracker RTTY, indicating that Pi cam is online
** Debug switch which causes RTTY to say things?

Pi tracker:
* Read up on bluetooth initialization; maybe I need to configure this?

* Have some kind of remote debug port / method. Another serial port? Way to activate HDMI port? (could have getty auto-login to a shell? security is not important.)
* Sync GPS clock to system
* NOFIX sentence puts me in bermuda?
* Buy another GPS antenna and shorten lead; move GPS board 2cm in to fit inside box
* Huge output buffer = 60-120s of real-time delay
** At the same time, can we log sensor data more frequently?
* Onboard voltage sensor(s)

Canon A810:
* Canon A810 clock sync
* Take photos more frequently
* Sharpen / quality? Tinker with infinity focus

Launch procedure:
* Take a photo of a RTC with both cameras?
* Debug switch or debug first 100 sentences or below 1000m?


FIXED, requires testing:
* Internal temperature (lm75) signed/unsigned
