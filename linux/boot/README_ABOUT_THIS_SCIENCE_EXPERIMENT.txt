This is an amateur science experiment project.
If you're reading this file, you're clever enough to pull an SD card out of a Pi and read it.

This computer is part of a High Altitude Balloon (HAB) payload which is sent up into the atmosphere attached to a helium balloon. The data on the Linux partition in /var/log/syslog might give you a clue as to the date and location from which this was launched.

To find the owner, best bet is to send an email to the UK High Altitude Society (UKHAS) mailing list with a picture of the payload and roughly where you live.  The owner of this payload will probably offer you a reward and huge thanks if you post it back to the owner.
